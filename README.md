## Dimension Estimation module

This is a module, initially just for testing. There are multiple approaches for this task. First, the approach may vary depending on the model the user has. LiDAR or camera based methods. We are going to move forwards first with the camera based (monocular).

It's important to note that this code just get the camera monocular input. This method on the repo just processes monocular videos to measure HVACs Width, Heigth and Depth.
